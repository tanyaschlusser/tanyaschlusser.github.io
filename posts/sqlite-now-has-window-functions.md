### SQLite database
    
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>, written in C, is massively underrated. They say themselves they're not an enterprise database, but from their <a href="https://sqlite.org/whentouse.html">'when to use' page</a>, <quote>"Generally speaking, any site that gets fewer than 100K hits/day should work fine with SQLite."</quote> Plus, since the <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html">sqlite3</a> database api is in Python's standard library, it's perfect for personal projects. And for a cherry on top: it looks like windowing functions, intended to behave as described in the PostgreSQL documentation, are <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/draft/windowfunctions.html">in the works</a> for the next release. Rah SQLite!
